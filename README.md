## P523-Rust


P523 is a classic compiler course taught by R. Kent Dybvig. This repo implements the course using Rust, provides a framework to help you master P523.

You are expected to start from [adventure](./adventure), write your own code until you finally arrive at A15. It is not really scare as it sounds, since if you are able to pass the A1, you are able to pass A2, A3 and so on.

The P523 PDF files spreaded around the Internet is the main materials you have to read again and again. Asides, the reference codes serve as hints.
